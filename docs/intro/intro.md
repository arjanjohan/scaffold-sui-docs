# 👋 Welcome to Scaffold IOTA

🧪 Scaffold IOTA is an open-source, cutting-edge toolkit for building decentralized applications (dApps) on IOTA. It's designed to streamline the process of creating and deploying Move smart contracts and building user interfaces that interact seamlessly with these smart contracts.

⚙️ Built using Move, IOTA TS SDK, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

* 🛫 **Deployment Scripts**: Simplify and automate your deployment workflow.
* ✅ **Hot Contract Reload**: Your frontend automatically adapts to changes in your smart contracts as you redeploy them.
* 🪝 **Custom Hooks**: A collection of React hooks to simplify interactions with the IOTA blockchain
* 🧱 **Components**: A library of common Web3 components to rapidly build your frontend.
* 🔐 **Wallet Integration**: Connect to any IOTA-compatible wallet and interact with the IOTA network directly from your frontend.
