# Address

Display an address with a copy-to-clipboard icon and a visual blockie representation. The component offers the following features:

- Shows a shortened or full address format
- Provides a clickable link to the block explorer (can be disabled)
- Displays a blockie image unique to the address
- Includes a copy icon for easy address copying

When clicked, the address links to:
1. The block explorer of the connected wallet's network (if a wallet is connected)
2. The block explorer of the mainnet (if no wallet is connected)

This component is useful for displaying user addresses, contract addresses, or any Sui address in a user-friendly manner.
